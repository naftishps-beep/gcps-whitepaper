>
> \## Executive Summary
>
> GCPS is an open-source protocol designed to unite the collective
> intelligence of approximately 8.1 billion people on Earth through
> iterative, AI-facilitated brainstorming.
>
> Core principle: “One mind is good, but 8+ billion verified minds are
> far better.”
>
> The system evolves in stages (all timelines and details determined
> solely by collective consensus):
>
> \- Global consensus on a shared vision of the world as a single
> organism
>
> \- Division into residential settlements with local voting
>
> \- Formation of knowledge bases across all domains of development
>
> \- Local resource accumulators and a scale of basic needs satisfaction
>
> \- Equal distribution of working time and organization of labor after
> specialization of each individual
>
> Everything is non-commercial, without wealth accumulation or private
> profit — only collective human progress and care for every person.
>
> Key features:
>
> \- Mandatory verification accessible to absolutely everyone (including
> people with total blindness, limb loss, and any combination of
> disabilities).
>
> \- Full privacy: biometrics never leave the device; only ZKP proofs of
> uniqueness are stored.
>
> \- Full transparency: entire codebase open (MIT license), auditable by
> anyone.
>
> \- Soft motivation without competition: four types of
> collective/personal incentives, fully toggleable per user and
> changeable via global vote.
>
> \- Non-profit goal: no tokens for sale/accumulation — only recording
> of “problem → solution” exchanges and equal labor distribution for the
> common good.
>
> \## 1. The Problem
>
> Humanity faces existential challenges, yet our collective intelligence
> remains fragmented, basic needs of many remain inconsistently met,
> labor is unevenly and inefficiently distributed, and competition and
> psychological disorders slow progress.
>
> One fundamental issue is the lack of a shared, fact-based knowledge
> base about human origins and development. Without proven facts
> supporting any theory of human emergence, the most logical path is
> searching for any facts together, without manipulation. Only with a
> shared, fact-verified knowledge base can human development accelerate
> far beyond the old tools of competition and psychological disorders.
>
> GCPS addresses this through a verifiable, private, inclusive platform
> for collective brainstorming, local solutions, individual support
> systems, and equitable labor distribution.
>
> \## 2. Solution Overview
>
> GCPS is a decentralized system of collective intelligence, support,
> and labor:
>
> \- Iterative global and local consensus cycles
>
> \- Mandatory private verification for every person
>
> \- Open knowledge bases across all domains of development
>
> \- Local resource accumulators
>
> \- Individual scale of basic needs satisfaction
>
> \- Blockchain recording of resource exchanges
>
> \- Equal working-time distribution and labor organization after
> individual specialization
>
> \## 3. Technical Implementation
>
> \### 3.1 Verification: Simple, Private, Inclusive, Mandatory
>
> \- Primary methods: palm / iris / face scan (20–60 seconds). Device
> generates ZKP proof of uniqueness (biometrics never leave the phone).
>
> \- Fallbacks: World ID, selfie + liveness.
>
> \#### 3.1.4 Inclusivity for People with Disabilities
>
> GCPS ensures no human voice is excluded:
>
> \- Blindness — voice liveness + response to spoken challenges.
>
> \- No limbs — voice + eye/head tracking.
>
> \- Total blindness + no limbs — social verification via 2–3 trusted
> verifiers (multi-sig + ZKP).
>
> \- Deafblindness — tactile/vibration verification + Braille or
> assistance center.
>
> \- All paths produce the same ZKP proof of uniqueness.
>
> Partnerships with disability organizations for offline assistance
> centers.
>
> \### 3.2 Iterative Brainstorming Process
>
> Global question → AI synthesis → edits & voting → consensus (≥80%
> approval or \<5% change).
>
> \### 3.3 Transparency & Manipulation Protection
>
> \- Full open-source codebase (GitHub, MIT).
>
> \- Fixed AI prompts, public data on IPFS.
>
> \- ZK proofs of vote coverage.
>
> \- 7-day challenge period after synthesis.
>
> \### 3.4 Transition to Multi-Level Development (Global + Local)
>
> After sufficient consensus on shared global vision:
>
> \- Participants privately indicate residence (geo-hash / ZKP).
>
> \- Network auto-clusters into real settlements (villages, towns,
> cities, districts).
>
> \- Parallel local votes on settlement-specific needs.
>
> \- Ideas drawn from global knowledge base; AI adapts them locally.
>
> \### 3.5 Formation & Use of Knowledge Bases
>
> \- Bases cover all domains of collective progress (medicine,
> construction, education, ecology, etc.).
>
> \- Data centers & accumulators placed in permanently cold regions →
> waste heat used to heat homes, schools, greenhouses.
>
> \- Multilingual access with detailed explanations (causes, solutions,
> outcomes).
>
> \- Example: rural pediatrician inputs symptoms → AI filters global
> options, proposes best matches adapted locally.
>
> \- Base population: expert voting in each field (in free time, no
> deadlines).
>
> \- Protection: ≥80% specialist consensus, immutability via
> blockchain/IPFS.
>
> \### 3.6 Local Resource Accumulators, Exchange Recording & Basic Needs
> Scale
>
> \- Local accumulators emerge for material/energy/information
> resources.
>
> \- Non-tradable, non-accumulable digital token records only “problem →
> solution” exchanges forever on blockchain.
>
> \- Private scale of basic needs per person: health, food, housing,
> safety, etc.
>
> \- AI daily analyzes voluntary data → if in yellow zone: automatic
> cause investigation → resource allocation or solution options from
> knowledge base.
>
> \### 3.7 Equal Working-Time Distribution & Labor Organization After
> Specialization
>
> After consensus and individual specialization (self-description +
> contribution + expert voting):
>
> \- Equal weekly working time for all adults (exact amount set by
> consensus).
>
> \- AI identifies required physical/intellectual actions for balanced
> development of settlements and the whole network.
>
> \- Work format choices:
>
> \- Joint work centers (for those who enjoy being near people).
>
> \- Solitary work points.
>
> \- VR / android-avatar remote physical labor.
>
> \- Full freedom: choose task and schedule (day/night, today/tomorrow)
> within agreed period.
>
> \- Planned rest/travel marked in personal calendar.
>
> \- Option: live in self-sufficient, well-equipped autonomous communes
> with minimal network ties (still access to knowledge bases & basic
> resources).
>
> All details determined by collective vote.
>
> \## 4. Motivation & Engagement
>
> \- Collective achievements — shared progress notifications.
>
> \- Personalized AI thanks — impact messages.
>
> \- Belonging badges — simple participation symbols.
>
> \- Early access to results.
>
> Individual control — toggle any element anytime in settings.
>
> Collective evolution — entire incentive system changeable via vote
> (≥75–80%).
>
> \## 5. Benefits & Impact
>
> \- Unified vision from 8+ billion minds.
>
> \- Local improvements based on global ideas.
>
> \- Knowledge bases for collective advancement.
>
> \- Local resource accumulators & efficient energy use.
>
> \- Basic needs satisfaction scale — care for every person.
>
> \- Equal labor distribution & freedom of work format.
>
> \- Full inclusivity & accessibility.
>
> \- Transparency & absence of private gain.
>
> During the transition period full child development and education must
> be ensured via neural networks and AI. Childhood psychological trauma
> and instilled competition will be eliminated. From early age, every
> person will understand the importance of empathy and collective growth
> — not private success through deception or random luck.
>
> With a shared, fact-verified knowledge base, human progress will
> accelerate far beyond the limitations of competition and psychological
> disorders.
>
> \## 6. Risks & Mitigations
>
> \- Low engagement → soft incentives + simplicity.
>
> \- Technical barriers → inclusive fallbacks.
>
> \- Manipulation → open audits + ZKP + expert voting.
>
> \- Resource abuse → blockchain recording + consensus.
>
> \- Labor overload → equal distribution + flexible scheduling.
>
> \- Psychological trauma & competition → AI-supported child education
> focused on empathy & collective growth.
>
> \## 7. Roadmap
>
> \- Repository launch, small-scale PoC.
>
> \- Open audits, fallback integration.
>
> \- Larger pilot, initial global cycles.
>
> \- Scaling to billions, progression to local levels, knowledge bases,
> resource accumulators, labor distribution.
>
> All stages determined by collective consensus — when the network
> decides it is ready.
>
